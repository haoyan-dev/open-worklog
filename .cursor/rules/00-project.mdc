# Open Worklog — AI editing rules

## General

- Follow existing patterns and file structure; avoid drive-by refactors.
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the request.
- Do not change API contracts casually; if you change a response/request shape, update both backend + frontend accordingly.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless clearly necessary.
- Do not add telemetry/debug ingestors (e.g. `fetch("http://127.0.0.1:.../ingest")`) or leave temporary debug scaffolding behind.

## Time & timezone invariants (critical)

- Backend stores timestamps as **naive UTC datetimes**; API serializes timestamps as ISO 8601 (typically with `Z`).
- Frontend should treat backend timestamps as UTC and send timestamps with timezone info (prefer `Z`).
